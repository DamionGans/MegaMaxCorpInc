Hello
My name is Mr. Hackerman
And in my valuable time
I found your server
So.. ehmmm..
YOUR SECURITY SUCKS!!!
You are the IT administrator right?
YOU SHOULD DO BETTER!
Shame on you and your (non existing) skills!
...
So I hacked your system
And knew I had to do something..
Yes you even managed
TO HAVE ME PITTY YOUR MEGAMAXCORPINC ORGANISATION
FOR THIS BAD SECURITY
So I couldntt leave this server be
And decided to help you
FOR FREE!!!
But with cost
Because next time I want a better challenge hacking your server
So....
I made some challenges for you
Mr IT-guy haHAHAHAhaHAAHAaaa
First one:
Login to this server with SSH
Simple, you say?
WELL WHY SUCH A BADLY SECURED SERVER THEN?
Allright good luck
I will help you
bye
