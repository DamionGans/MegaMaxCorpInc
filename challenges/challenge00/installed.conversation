Hello
My name is Hackerman
Or actually, MR. HACKERMAN
And in my precious time
I found your corporate server
...
YOUR SECURITY REALLY SUCKS!!!
So you are the IT administrator right?
SHAME ON YOU AND YOUR (NON EXISITING) SKILLS!
So I hacked your server
And it was so easy
IT DIDN'T EVEN FEEL LIKE HACKING!!
I knew I had to do something..
Yes you even managed
TO HAVE ME PITTY YOUR MEGAMAXCORPINC ORGANISATION
FOR SUCH BAD SECURITY
So I simply couldn't leave this server be
And decided to help you
FOR FREE!!!
But not without costs
Because next time I want a better challenge when I'm hacking your server
So....
I have made some challenges for you
Mr IT-guy haHAHAHAhaHAAHAaaa
First one:
Login to your server and get a file from your home directory
Simple, you say?
WELL WHY DO YOU HAVE SUCH A BADLY SECURED SERVER THEN?
Allright good luck
